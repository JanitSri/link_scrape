In the\n    spirit of that, this coming February Vigilant will officially take on the DRW brand.", 'My journey to Vigilant wasnâ\x80\x99t a standard software developer path, since my undergrad and masters were in biochemistry. After I finished, I decided to change domains, getting a graduate diploma in computer science. I first worked for startup where we were developing a machine learning system applied to online advertising. While itâ\x80\x99s not the same subject matter, working for a firm that trades in the financial markets is similar to the learning system as it deals with capturing and processing a lot of data quickly and efficiently.', 'As a software developer I write a lot of tools, but often Iâ\x80\x99m not the one to use these tools most extensively.  When I came out of school, I thought that you build a project and youâ\x80\x99re done with it, given you do some work to eliminate some user reported bugs. However, I found out thatâ\x80\x99s not the case. Now I understand that it takes iteration to make a performant, stable and easy to use product. It doesnâ\x80\x99t happen on the first try. You have to take time to do multiple rounds of reflection and refinement, and even sometimes start over to get something right. Getting user feedback in this process is critically important.', 'My day at Vigilant starts with reading emails and reviewing code made the previous day or checking the status of our overnight data processing jobs. Then we usually have our team standup and, depending on what comes up, I may follow that with pairing with a teammate or responding to an issue that required team consensus. Being a team that provides a historical market data API to the rest of the company, weâ\x80\x99re fielding questions and bug reports daily. Weâ\x80\x99re also keeping an eye out for issues, keeping alert for any potential crashes.  If there are no issues in our stack, Iâ\x80\x99ll turn to my projects for the rest of the day, like writing decoders for financial exchange data.', 'I really enjoy problem solving and learning â\x80\x93 something that hasnâ\x80\x99t stopped since Iâ\x80\x99ve been at Vigilant. Iâ\x80\x99m now using two new languages and have learned a lot about trading. The tools I use daily include vim, debugger, git, Java and different IDEs adapted to the languages we use. Learning to use the debugger correctly was a great time investment, since itâ\x80\x99s now one of the first things I turn to when facing a bug.', 'Curiosity is an important skill for a software developer. You have to really love taking things apart and looking inside to see how they are made. Weâ\x80\x99re doing this all the time as developers, and you have to be driven to dive through all of the layers. Developers also need to have a strong imagination. Software development is sometimes like trying to put together an abstract puzzle for which we may only have a certain set of pieces and need to make our own pieces that fit. Holding a mental model and imagining how to connect and interact with many different APIs is just like that.', 'Coding is a craft. It requires discipline, attention to detail, and a willingness to constantly correct and improve. Working as a software developer at Vigilant was unexpected when I was in school, but Iâ\x80\x99m glad my path led me here.']

He runs competitively year round in all weather, from the frigid Montreal winters to the extreme heat of South Africa and the Florida Everglades. This past Monday, Craigie took to the streets of Boston, finishing one of the most famous marathons in the world. We sat down with him post-run to get the inside scoop:', 'When did you decide to run the Boston Marathon?', 'The Boston Marathon is like the Super Bowl of marathon racing. It’s a race I’ve wanted to run since I was young, just to say that I’ve run it. But to be honest, it’s not a spur of the moment decision. You can’t just decide to run the Boston Marathon, go to the website, sign-up and run the race. It’s a process.', 'First, you have to run a marathon on a Boston certified course and finish in a time that meets their age and gender requirements for entry. Then you have to apply online on their specific registration day (usually early September) to run the race the following year in April.  They have a lot of strict rules and tough qualifying time requirements, but they want to make sure you put in the work to run this amazing race. You can get more details on whatâ\x80\x99s required on the Boston Athletic Association’s site. [http://www.baa.org/races/boston-marathon/participant-information/athlete-registration.aspx]', 'What was it like training for it? Where and how do you train?', 'Training for Boston is tough when you live in Montreal. The race is always in mid-April so training should start in January/February and it’s pretty ugly to run outside here in the freezing cold. You’re lucky if you get to run outside at all before the big day. Almost all my training was done on the treadmill at the gym to avoid running on the icy and snowy streets of Montreal. It can be tough to get excited about putting in sessions on the treadmill day after day but I try to focus on my ‘why’ and enjoy the process.', 'How did the Boston Marathon compare to other races youâ\x80\x99ve done? What was the atmosphere like?', 'It truly was an incredible experience. The race starts in Hopkintin, MA and you run for 42.2km into the city center of Boston. streets are full of spectators the entire way cheering you on, giving high fives, and handing out water. They estimate more than 500,000 people are out watching the race.Their cheering keeps you going during the times you’re struggling. Words can’t describe how exhilarating it is.', 'Your time was ultra-impressive! How did you feel about it? Beat any personal bests?', 'Thanks for the kudos on my time! It wasn’t a personal best, but I am very proud considering I didn’t get to train much on the road and the day as very hot (mid 20 degrees C). My Montreal skin wasn’t used to all that sun.', 'What next for you? Any plans for future races?', 'My next major marathon will either be Montreal or Toronto…still deciding. Both are in the fall of this year and both are very different. Toronto is flat while Montreal is hilly. Both will be challenging in their own ways. I’ll be doing a few half marathons and shorter races during the summer to prepare for those races.', 'Anything else youâ\x80\x99d like to add?', 'â\x80\x8bI grew a mustache and long side burns for this race to honor my favorite runner Steve Prefontaine. He was a running legend from the U.S. but tragically died at the young age of 24.', 'To follow Eoinâ\x80\x99s athletic journey, visit his Facebook Page here.']

Because I knew a lot about how the desk worked and had a fundamental understanding of the strategy it used, it was a natural transition into the equity analyst position.Â\xa0 Since taking the position, I have been happy to see the progress that we have made on the desk and look forward to its growth.Â\xa0 I can’t imagine a better place to start and grow my career.']

While I was setting up my desk and getting access to my Bloomberg terminal, the hustle and bustle on the trading floor - which now feels so familiar - was energizing and made me even more eager to dive into my work.\n                    ']

When I was growing up, girls were often encouraged to pursue careers in education, law and medicine, while toys and hobbies related to technology were marketed to boys. Thanks to my parents, I was exposed to computing at a young age when they gave me a computer on my eighth birthday. In my schooling, they encouraged my interest in mathematics and science right up until I graduated from Concordia University in 2013 with a degree in software engineering. I think itâ\x80\x99s important that everyone is exposed to technology early and, if they show interest, that theyâ\x80\x99re encouraged to pursue it.', 'I start my days as a software developer for Vigilant with a commute on the train, when I check our internal communication channel and listen to â\x80\x9cThe Dailyâ\x80\x9d podcast. From there, Iâ\x80\x99ll head into team meetings where I catch up on my teammatesâ\x80\x99 projects and the technologies theyâ\x80\x99re using â\x80\x93 thatâ\x80\x99s really important as a test developer. Here at Vigilant, collaboration is a must. Iâ\x80\x99m not solely responsible for the work we produce. Everything is a team effort and weâ\x80\x99re continuously developing our skills and work processes, something that makes me proud. The rest of my day is full of development and code review, with some time taken out to mentor our interns.', 'As a software developer, I believe in applying the Socratic paradox to all of my projects - the only thing I know is that I know nothing. To be a good software developer, you must not be afraid to break things. To be a good test developer, you must like breaking things. Itâ\x80\x99s important to approach each project openly, with a willingness to learn â\x80\x93 and a willingness to fail.', 'When Iâ\x80\x99m asked for advice on becoming a developer, my answer is always to follow your passion for engineering â\x80\x93 life is more fulfilling when youâ\x80\x99re doing what you love. Itâ\x80\x99s true that the field is more heavily male right now, but as more girls are exposed to technology and encouraged to pursue it, things will become more balanced and Iâ\x80\x99m looking forward to seeing the change.']
